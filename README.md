# Solar Panel Fault Detection Using Transfer Learning with EfficientNet



Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are increasingly being used globally to meet growing energy demands sustainably. However, the efficiency of solar panels can be compromised by various external factors, including physical damage, environmental conditions, and obstruction by debris. Regular manual inspections are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. Consequently, automated systems capable of detecting and categorizing faults in solar panels are highly desirable.This study focuses on automating solar panel fault detection using image classification techniques. By leveraging the power of transfer learning and pre-trained models, we aim to develop a robust solution for classifying different types of faults. EfficientNet, a widely-used deep learning model, is fine-tuned to achieve high accuracy in detecting specific solar panel faults. Our approach seeks to improve the accuracy and efficiency of solar panel maintenance processes.automate the monitoring and maintenance process, reducing downtime and maximizing energy efficiency.
